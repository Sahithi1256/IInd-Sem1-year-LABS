**_EXPERIMENT-10_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program to allocate memory using new operator
##
**_Step-by-step process of the Experiment:_**<br/>
1.The memory allocation to the variables of primitive data type can be performed dynamically using new operator.<br/>
2.Declare a pointer ptr as an int.<br/>
3.initialized pointer ptr to a integer value.<br/>
4.print the pointer value in the output.<br/>
