name, roll_no and grade as data members.<br/>
read_info() and display_info() as member functions.<br/>
3.Implement the void read() and void display() member functions.<br/>
4.Create a main() method.<br/>
5.Create an object of the above class inside the main() method.<br/>
6.Make function calls to void read() and void display() using class object.<br/>
