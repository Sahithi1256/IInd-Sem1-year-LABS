**_EXPERIMENT-3_**
#
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program to read the data of N employee and compute Net salary of
each employee (DA=52% of Basic and Income Tax (IT) =30% of the gross salary).

#
**_Step-by-step process for the Experiment:_**<br/>
1.Include the required header files (iostream.h).<br/>
2.Create a class Employee with the following members.<br/>
name, id, basic, DA, IT, net_salary,  as data memebrs.<br/>
void get_details() and void print_details() as member functions.<br/>
3.Create a main() method.<br/>
4.Create an array of class object with (e) a specific size and i as integer.<br/>
5.Read i.<br/>
6.Call the get_details() method through the array of class object from 0 to i.<br/>
7.Call the print_details() method through the array of class object from 0 to i.<br/>
