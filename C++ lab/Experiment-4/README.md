**_EXPERIMENT-4_**
#
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program to declare Struct. Initialize and display contents of member
Variables.

#
**_Step-by-step process for the algorithm:_**<br/>
1.Include the required header files (iostream.h).<br/>
2.Create a structure (student) with the following member variables.<br/>
Name, roll_no, branch, and grade as data members.<br/>
3.Create a main() method.<br/>
4.Create a variable of the above structure inside the main() method.<br/>
5.Then, read data into member variables of that structure using structure variable with dot operator.<br/>
6.Finally, display data of member variables of that structure using structure variable with dot operator.<br/>
