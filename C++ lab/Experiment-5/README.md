**_EXPERIMENT-5_**
#
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Write a C++ program to declare a class. Declare pointer to class. Initialize and display the
contents of the class member.

#
**_Step-by-step process of the Experiment:_**<br/>
1.Include the required header files (iostream.h, string).<br/>
2.Create a class (employee) with the following members as public members.
Name, ID, Salary as data members.
void read() ,void display() as member functions.<br/>
Step 3 - Create a main() method.<br/>
Step 4 - Create a variable (e) and a pointer variable (ptr) of the above class inside the main() method.<br/>
Step 5 - Assign the address of class object (e) to class pointer object (ptr).<br/>
Step 6 - Then, call the member functions void read() ,void display() using class pointer object (ptr) to illustrate member functions access using class pointer.<br/>
Step 7 - Assign values to data members of the class using class pointer object to illustrate data members access using class pointer.<br/>
Step 8 - Finally, call the member functions void read() ,void display() using class pointer object (ptr).<br/>
