**_EXPERIMENT-12_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
12a)Write a C++  Program to illustrate early binding.  
12b)Write a C++  Program to illustrate late binding 
12c)Write a C++  Program to illustrate  concept of Virtual Functions
12d)Write a C++  Program on Abstract classes 
##
**_Theory / Definitions of terms in Experiment:_**
1.The early binding (static binding) refers to compile time binding and late binding (dynamic binding) refers to runtime binding.
2.Early Binding uses the class information to resolve method calling while Late Binding uses the object to resolve method calling.
3.A C++ virtual function is a member function in the base class that you redefine in a derived class. It is declared using the virtual keyword. It is used to tell the compiler to perform dynamic linkage or late binding on the function.
4.An abstract class is a class that is designed to be specifically used as a base class. An abstract class contains at least one pure virtual function.
