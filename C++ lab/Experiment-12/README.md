**_EXPERIMENT-12_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**<br/>
12a)Write a C++  Program to illustrate early binding.<br/>12b)Write a C++  Program to illustrate late binding <br/>
12c)Write a C++  Program to illustrate  concept of Virtual Functions<br/>
12d)Write a C++  Program on Abstract classes 
##
**_Theory / Definitions of terms in Experiment:_**<br/>
1.The early binding (static binding) refers to compile time binding and late binding (dynamic binding) refers to runtime binding.<br/>
2.Early Binding uses the class information to resolve method calling while Late Binding uses the object to resolve method calling.<br/>
3.A C++ virtual function is a member function in the base class that you redefine in a derived class. It is declared using the virtual keyword. It is used to tell the compiler to perform dynamic linkage or late binding on the function.<br/>
4.An abstract class is a class that is designed to be specifically used as a base class. An abstract class contains at least one pure virtual function.<br/>
