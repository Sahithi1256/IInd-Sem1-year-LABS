**_EXPERIMENT-9_**
##
**_Aim of the Experiment:_**
Program to demonstrate Constructors ; Destructors
##
**_Step-by-step process of the experiment:_**<br/>
1.A constructor which does not receive any parameters is called a Default Constructor, or a ‘Zero Argument Constructor’.<br/>
2.A Parameterized Constructor, which is a constructor that can accept one or more arguments. This helps programmers to assign varied initial values to an object at the time of creation.<br/>
3.Copy constructor is a type of constructor which is used to create a copy of an already existing object of a class type.<br/>
4.Destructor is invoked when the instance is destroyed.<br/>
